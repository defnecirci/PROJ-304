# PROJ-304

This repository is created to gather some of my codes that I used in my Computer Science compultory internship in Sabanci University .

leaflet.R is written to create a World map with information about the number of people who diED beccause of COVID-19 mapped to each country.

Figure1_Clusters.R is written to visualize clusters aligned with the tree. The figure can be seen from our article: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.095794v1.full

hmm.py is written to form hmm profiles which are used to test whether there is any computationally less expensive method to determine clusters.
